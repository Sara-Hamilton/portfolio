          <h1>about me</h1>
          <p>I grew up in Albuquerque, New Mexico where I developed a love of <em>green chiles.</em>  I moved to Portland, Oregon to attend Lewis & Clark College.  I love living in Portland.  The people are friendly.  There are always new, interesting restaurants to try.  The city is very walkable.  I enjoy solving puzzles and <em>learning new things.</em>  Computer programming and web development are a great combination of these two things.</p>

            <p>I worked for many years in the field of <span class="bg-success">high-tech manufacturing</span> as a manufacturing operator, mostly soldering tiny components with the aid of a microscope.  Many of my co-workers had difficulty and were frustrated with the ERP system (Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009) that was used for transactions. It was somewhat difficult to learn, and it was easy to make mistakes while transacting.  I enjoyed the challenging of figuring out the ways of the system and often helped my co-workers when they had problems or questions pertaining to the software.  Over time, I became the local subject matter expert and was nicknamed <span class="bg-success">"The AX Guru"</span>.  I was the first line of support before escalating an issue to IT.  I worked with IT on a regular basis troubleshooting, testing, and suggesting improvements.  Over time, the IT department developed a GUI to help with AX transactions.  I had much input into the developement of the GUI.  I created and gave all of the training for how to use the GUI at the Hillsboro site.  I helped each production line transition to using the GUI. While I enjoyed learning about AX and the internal GUI, I grew frustrated with the fact that I did not understand the code behind the GUI.</p>

            <p>I learned about a computer training program called <span class="bg-success">LaunchCode</span> that was offering free computer skills training.  I applied and was accepted.  Through this program I learned how to program in Python and Java.  I also learned how to use the frameworks Flask and Spring. I learned how to make websites and store information in databases. I really enjoyed this introduction to computer programming, but did not feel quite job ready when I completed the program.</p>
            <p>I decided to attend another coding school called <span class="bg-success">Epicodus</span> to learn Javascript and C#.  This will give me the opportunity to learn some more programming languages and to practice and develop my programming skills.  I may persue a career working as a developer in a high-tech manufacturing facility.  C# is commonly used at these facilities.</p>
